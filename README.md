# Mini Mining

A relaxing idle mining game. Do other things then come back and see how your little friends are doing. Or keep them off to the side and interact as you go.

## Bugs

- Placing mining resources when a construction bot is mid movement sometimes causes the bot to change and go after the newly placed node

## Random Ideas

- Construction bots
    - These can create and destroy resource nodes
    - When a resource node is depleted go "re-create" it if the player has the necessary resources
        - Define how much of what resource is required to re-create the node (original purchase price?)

- Fully delete a node/building/bot
    - TNT explosion on it b/c that sounds fun
    - I don't want the player to be able to move things around without consequences so to "move" something you have to blow it up and start again

- Extra layer as a bar driven by profits of the mining
    - It has the ability to make drinks and upgrade over time
