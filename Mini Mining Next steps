Progression
	- I should create a draw.io doc for this and map out what I would want it to be
	- Start with Copper and Coal unlocked
		- ONLY small resources tho
		- Maybe start with only coal unlocked and copper deposit takes 100 coal mined (maybe)
	- Iron has to be unlocked with ???

			- Unlock with a "cost"
				- 250 coal and ...
